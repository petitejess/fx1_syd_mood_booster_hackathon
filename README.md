## Purpose

The app would show a quote based on the user's mood in a hope to boost the mood.

&nbsp;  

## User Interface

The homepage will have 8 mood buttons for users to click: **Happy** button, **Sad** button, **Excited** button, **Tired** button, **Scared** button, **Anxious** button, **Confused** button, **Bored** button.

Once the user clicks one of the buttons, all the buttons will be replaced with a section that shows the quote. The background container of the quote would change following the colour of each button clicked.

A **Try Again** button will show up below the quote section for the user to click to restart from beginning.

&nbsp;  

## How The App Works

Each button has different mood that corresponds to different quote categories provided by an API.

For example, a Happy button will give a random quote from category "happiness". The corresponding buttons and quote categories are currently being hard coded as following:

- Happy button: *"happiness"* category
- Sad button: *"positive"* category
- Excited button: *"amazing"* category
- Tired button: *"strength"* category
- Scared button: *"courage"* category
- Anxious button: *"peace"* category
- Confused button: *"wisdom"* category
- Bored button: *"funny"* category

A fetch request is made to an API to get a single quote from the category, which then rendered to the DOM.

The page has elements that are shown or hidden using CSS property *display* manipulation that will swap elements to give a feeling of a Single Page Application.

The controllers to swap the elements are the mood buttons and the Try Again button. When a user clicks one of the mood buttons, it will cause all elements that have class name *homepage-element* to be hidden and the elements that have class name *quotepage-element* to be shown. The Try Again button will do the reverse.

The background colour for the quote would also change following the colour of the button clicked. The behaviour is done by adding extra argument *colour code*, besides *category*, to be passed on to the function that manipulate the DOM.

## Third Party Services

API used in this app is [**Famous Quotes API**](https://rapidapi.com/saicoder/api/famous-quotes4/).

This app is deployed on **AWS S3**, and using **CloudFront CDN**.
